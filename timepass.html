<h3>Studying</h3>
<p>Nowadays my only goal is to find an internship which can help me learn a lot
    of things which can't be learned by books but only by experiencing it. So to do 
    that, I am codiing and practicing new skills related to python language through 
    Leetcode.<br>
    Another skill I'm practicing right now is Web Development. One of my friends was
    kind enough to lend me her course on the same which she had already paid for.
